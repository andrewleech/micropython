    bool "Enable generic SD Card driver (SPI)"
    default n # Usually enabled by ports needing it
    help
      Include the generic SD Card driver layer which uses an SPI interface.
      Requires the port to provide low-level SPI communication functions
      and GPIO control for the chip select (CS) pin.
      If selected, the `sdcard` module and VFS support for SD cards may be
      enabled by the port.

config MICROPY_HW_SPIFLASH_ENABLE_CACHE
    bool "Enable cache for generic SPI Flash driver"
    default y
    help
      Enable a RAM-based cache for the generic SPI Flash driver.
      This can improve performance for filesystem operations on SPI flash
      by reducing the number of physical read/write operations, at the cost
      of increased RAM usage for the cache buffer.

# Add other generic driver options here if needed
# e.g., options for generic I2C drivers, display drivers, etc.

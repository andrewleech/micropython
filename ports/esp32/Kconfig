    comment "ESP32 Specific Settings"

    # Note: Many core ESP32 features (CPU freq, Flash/RAM config, WiFi, Bluetooth,
    #       peripherals like TWAI/CAN, I2S, etc.) are configured via the ESP-IDF
    #       Kconfig system (usually run via `idf.py menuconfig`), not directly here.
    #       This file mainly controls MicroPython-level integration or options
    #       not covered by IDF's Kconfig.

    config MICROPY_HW_ENABLE_SDCARD
        bool "Enable SD Card Host driver (sdmmc_host)"
        default n
        help
          Enable the ESP-IDF SD Card Host driver (`sdmmc_host`) for SD card access
          (typically via SDIO or SPI, depending on board hardware).
          Requires appropriate pins configured in the board files and enabling
          SD/MMC support in the ESP-IDF configuration.
          If enabled, allows mounting SD cards in the VFS.

    # Example of a potential future ESP32-specific option:
    # config MICROPY_ESP32_SPIRAM_SUPPORT
    #    bool "Enable PSRAM/SPIRAM Support"
    #    default n # Usually set via IDF Kconfig
    #    help
    #      Configure MicroPython heap to utilize available PSRAM/SPIRAM.
    #      Requires PSRAM to be enabled and configured in ESP-IDF Kconfig.

    comment "Common Option Defaults for ESP32"
    # Common options are defined in py/ or extmod/. Defaults are generally
    # set based on ESP-IDF Kconfig or standard MicroPython levels.
    # Check common Kconfig files for specific default logic.

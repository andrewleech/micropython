          Specifies the approximate available code size on the target MCU.
          This influences which features (like frozen modules) are included
          by default based on the MCU series.
          (This is usually set automatically by the build system based on the selected MCU).

            Use a portion of the internal flash memory of the SAMD MCU for
            the primary filesystem (usually mounted at "/").
            This is the default filesystem location if no external QSPI or SPI
            flash is configured for the board.

    # Placeholders for board-specific QSPI/SPI flash config
    # These would typically be selected/enabled by the board's Kconfig fragment
    # or mpconfigboard.h/mk based on hardware presence.

          Indicates that an external QSPI flash chip is present and configured
          on the board, potentially for use as a filesystem or for other storage.

          Indicates that an external SPI flash chip is present and configured

    comment "Common Option Defaults for SAMD"
    # Note: Defaults for common options are generally handled in py/ or extmod/ Kconfig.
    # Check common Kconfig files for specific default logic based on PORT_SAMD.
    # Key defaults include:
    # - MICROPY_PY_BUILTINS_COMPLEX: n
    # - MICROPY_ERROR_REPORTING: TERSE
    # - MICROPY_PY_OS_DUPTERM: 3
    # - MICROPY_PY_TIME_GMTIME_LOCALTIME_MKTIME: y
    # - MICROPY_PY_TIME_TIME_TIME_NS: y

    config MICROPY_HW_ENABLE_DOUBLE_TAP
        bool "Enable double-tap reset to enter BOOTSEL"
        default y
        help
          Enable the feature where rapidly double-tapping the reset button
          (or RUN pin) causes the RP2040 to enter the USB Mass Storage
          bootloader mode (BOOTSEL).

    config MICROPY_C_HEAP_SIZE
        hex "C Heap Size (bytes) (0=disable)"
        default 0
        help
          Size of a dedicated C heap in bytes, allocated separately from the
          MicroPython GC heap. If enabled (non-zero), this heap is used by
          certain libraries or components that require standard `malloc`.
          If set to 0, the GC heap is used for C allocations if needed,
          or C allocations might fail if not supported by the GC allocator.
          Note: The RP2 port often does not require a separate C heap.

    # Add other RP2 specific options here, e.g.:
    # config MICROPY_HW_RP2_PIO_NUM_STATE_MACHINES
    #    int "Number of PIO State Machines to reserve"
    #    range 0 8
    #    default 4
    #    help
    #      Specify how many PIO state machines are reserved for use by the
    #      `rp2` module. The rest remain available for other uses.

    comment "Common Option Defaults for RP2"
    # Note: Defaults for common options are generally handled in py/ or extmod/ Kconfig.
    # RP2 port typically enables a rich set of features.
    # Check common Kconfig files for specific default logic.
